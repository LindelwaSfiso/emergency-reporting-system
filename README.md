# Emergency Reporting Application

This is a project that aims to provide a mechanism for reporting emergencies in the Kingdom of Eswatini. It unifies all existing emergency 
contact numbers into a compact system in which the user is not required to know all of these numbers.

The technology will automatically route a victim to the nearest service point, rather than connecting via a base station as it currently does. 
The system should be able to notify all users of an impending emergency. 
For example, if there is a significant traffic accident, emergency personnel should be able to notify the general public so that other 
routes may be used.

To improve on current solutions, the mobile application will send the user's data and GPS coordinates to the emergency response station. 
This allows the emergency response station to rapidly pinpoint the victim and so respond to them much more swiftly.

In a crisis, we customarily want to contact our loved ones so they can rush to our rescue, but this may be time consuming if you have a 
significant number of people to notify.
The app provides a better and quicker way to achieve this by allowing the victim to register emergency contacts,
and the app will send bulk SMS messages to these contacts in the event of an emergency.
The SMS also contains the victim's location.
