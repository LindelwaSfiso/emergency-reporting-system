# Emergency Reporting Application

This is a project aimed at developing a system that will be used for reporting emergencies in the Kingdom of Eswatini. It
combines all emergency contact numbers currently available into a compact system, where the user is not required to
know all these numbers.

The system will automatically route a victim to the nearest service point without having to connect via a base station
as it is now.

The system should be able to alert all users about a pending emergency, for example if there is serious road accident,
emergency personnel should be able to notify the general public about the accident so they can take alternative routes.

The app will also have weather forecasting abilities, this will help people plan ahead to avoid emergencies.

The system will also be used to notify emergency contact numbers of a victim if they need help. User should be able to
cancel an emergency via the application to avoid waste of resources.
